## Model
KupiaSec is a distinguished smart contract audit firm verified through public contests.
KupiaSec employs a [Multi-Phase Audit (MPA)](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F2wLrli4OmSaWiS8fXVUZ%2Fuploads%2FF27bi4xOgnXwDYeHS68f%2FDC%20Multi-Phase%20Audit.pdf?alt=media&token=c2ffdb11-13c7-439d-8acf-50e9fdff471e) process for the Private Audits, which consists of a **Solo Audit by a Lead Auditor**, an **Internal Competition** among all auditors, and a **Mitigation Review** to address the findings.

## Competitive & Transparent
Our pricing is transparent.
```solidity
uint256 SLOC = get_sloc_metrics(); // e.g. 1000 lines of Solidity code
uint256 D = SLOC / 200; // 5 business days for 1000 SLOC // @audit rounding down!
uint256 P = D * 2000e6; // 10K USDC
```
The pricing is very competitive while several auditors are engaged.
- We have an OG auditor as a lead on each audit.
- At least 3 other auditors will be in the second phase.

The whole audit process is shared transparently with the client using the GitHub project board.
