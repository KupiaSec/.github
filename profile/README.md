## Competitive & Transparent
Our pricing is transparent.
```solidity
uint256 SLOC = get_sloc_metrics(); // e.g. 1000 lines of Solidity code
uint256 D = SLOC / 100; // 10 work days for 1000 SLOC // @audit rounding down!
uint256 P = D * 2000e6; // 20K USDC
```
The pricing is very competitive while several auditors are engaged.
- We have an OG auditor as a lead on each audit.
- At least 3 other auditors will be in the second phase.

The whole audit process is shared transparently with the client using the GitHub project board.
